# 9d8 Turborepo, Tailwind, and Shadcn Starter

The simplist way to get started with Turborepo, Tailwind, and Shadcn (for now).

This is a starter project for using [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## Getting Started

1. Install [Turborepo CLI](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/installing) -> `npm install turbo --global` if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repo or make a copy of it (`Use template` button).
3. `cd` into the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `turbo build` to build the project.
6. If cache missed on the first build, run `turbo build` again.
7. Run `turbo dev` to start the development server.
